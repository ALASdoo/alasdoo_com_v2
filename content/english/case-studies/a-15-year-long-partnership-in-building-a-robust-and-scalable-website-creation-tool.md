## About the client

Our client's journey began in 2003 with a mission to make website creation accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical abilities. With a focus on simplicity and usability, they launched a website-building tool that became a household name in the industry.

This tool has enabled over 30 million websites to be created worldwide, with over 500.000 new websites launched every month.

## Clientâ€™s challenges

Initially, the client engaged us to perform manual testing of their website-building tool. However, as our expertise and value became evident, we took steps to improve the testing process by introducing automated test scripts. Our efforts resulted in faster and more efficient testing, allowing the client to roll out updates and new features more quickly. Impressed with our performance, the client subsequently hired us to provide Developer and DevOps services for their backend processes.

In 2022, our client was acquired by one of Europe's leading providers of online solutions, including domains, web hosting, and website creation tools. This strategic move consolidated the buyer's position as a market leader. To ensure a seamless transition for our client's customers, we oversaw the migration of their websites to the new company's infrastructure. This effort resulted in a hassle-free experience for around 60.000 paid customers who wanted to switch between website builders.

## Our approach

### Quality assurance

At the outset of the project, we offered manual testing services to our client. Our team collaborated closely with the development team to deliver a tool that was bug-free and provided a seamless user experience. By maintaining constant communication and leveraging our expertise, we were able to identify and resolve potential issues early in the development cycle, ensuring that the final product met the client's requirements and exceeded their expectations.

To further support our client's testing efforts, we also created automated test cases using Katalon solutions. By automating the testing process, we were able to quickly and efficiently test features and functionality, saving our client valuable time and resources. This enabled them to focus on other critical aspects of their business while ensuring the quality and reliability of their tool.

### Backend development

One of the key areas where we provided our expertise was in backend development using .net C#. This involved developing robust and scalable software solutions that would form the backbone of the website-building tool. Our team of experienced developers used their knowledge of .net C# to develop solutions that were efficient and reliable, ensuring that the client's website-building tool could handle the demands of millions of users worldwide.

Another area where we provided support was in DevOps services using the AWS stack. Our team worked on a website builder/selling online system with approximately 10 million free and 80.000 paying customers from across the globe. We had responsibility for keeping the entire system running over the course of more than 2 years. The system was completely hosted on AWS.

### Frontend development

Our team designed and implemented new features using the latest version of Angular. We ensured that the new features were compatible with the existing project, which included parts developed using a variety of other frameworks and technologies such as AngularJS, Backbone, ES6, and TypeScript. We employed best practices to ensure that the new code was maintainable, scalable, and future-proof.

Our team monitored the tool's performance, identified bottlenecks, and made performance enhancements wherever necessary.

We also implemented error handling mechanisms to ensure that the application was stable and reliable. Finally, we ensured that the application was internationalized, making it accessible to users in different regions and languages.

### Project management

The team lead we had provided for Developers and DevOps oversaw the development team's operations, ensuring that they were working efficiently and effectively and keeping them aligned with the client's goals and objectives.

We cooperated with this client for over 15 years. During the last 2 years on the project, we took care of entire operational services, as well as accounting services. Our COO oversaw the day-to-day operations of the company, ensuring smooth and seamless execution of processes, while our CFO executed expert financial management and accounting services.

## Value delivered

We take great pride in being an integral part of our client's journey by providing a comprehensive range of services that have been instrumental in supporting their operations. Our collaborative efforts have contributed to the success of their tool, which has been tried by an astounding 30 million users, with 10 million active free trials. These impressive numbers are a testament to the quality and effectiveness of their services, as well as the hard work and dedication of our team.

Our development expertise, manual testing, and creating automated test cases using Katalon have ensured that the website-building tool is robust and reliable. In addition, our DevOps services in the AWS stack have helped our client optimize their website-building tool's performance and scalability, making it even more accessible to a wider audience.

In addition to our range of services, we are proud to have provided our client with a dedicated Team Lead position for developers and DevOps teams, which resulted in increased efficiency and productivity.

Our COO services have also been invaluable in ensuring that our client's daily operations run seamlessly, allowing them to concentrate on their core mission of making website creation accessible to everyone.

As part of our commitment to delivering excellent service, we also made sure that the transition into the new buyer system was a smooth process for over 60.000 paying customers.
