## About the client

Our client's award&#8209;winning application is revolutionizing the way hospitals care for patients who become unconscious or mentally disabled. The application is designed to provide clear instructions and priorities for hospital staff in those situations, and to empower patients to make their own decisions about their care, even when they can't communicate.

The goal is to guide users through a well&#8209;designed questionnaire that helps them create customized documents outlining their directives for authorized personnel. Once completed and signed digitally, these documents are securely stored in a&nbsp;database.

By using the application and planning ahead, patients can avoid unnecessary suffering, receive the care they want, and spare their caregivers the difficult task of making tough decisions in moments of crisis or&nbsp;grief.

## Client’s challenges

The challenges in the healthcare field are increasing every year, the patients’ flow has increased, and in most cases, hospitals are insufficient to meet the needs of the population. The classic ways of sorting the personal data of patients, verifying their medical information, as well as the complexity of the treatments, inspired the creation of such an application that facilitates the work of the medical staff, with the patient as the main beneficiary.

For healthcare, the importance of the user experience cannot be overemphasized. The application has to be easy to use and accessible for people with all kinds of&nbsp;disabilities.

Mainly, patients’ privacy and data security are priorities that have to be guaranteed on day&#8209;to&#8209;day&nbsp;bases.

On the other hand, it is crucial to enable hospital staff to access critical information quickly and safely, ensuring that patients receive the best possible&nbsp;care.

## Our approach

The testing process begins with thorough planning and the creation of test scenarios to ensure comprehensive test coverage for clients' mobile and web&nbsp;platforms.

We also conduct accessibility testing to ensure that the platform can be used by participants with vision, hearing, cognitive, or physical disabilities.

Once this part of the testing is completed, we prepare comprehensive documentation that includes an evaluation of the application's current state and suggestions for addressing any accessibility&nbsp;issues.

The primary focus during testing is on the protection of the client's confidential data. Our exhaustive privacy and security assessment has to confirm that only authorized individuals can access and edit the document from the database. If the client is incapacitated, they can designate a trusted proxy with limited authorizations through an email&#8209;based invitation system. The proxy's access is restricted to the authorizations granted by the&nbsp;client.

With [Katalon](https://katalon.com/), we are able to automate our testing process and reduce the time and effort required to run comprehensive tests on the client's software&nbsp;product.

We cover both the technical and legal perspectives of the platform's functionality. It is crucial to provide practitioners and facilitators with the necessary tools to process enrollees' wishes. Practitioners review different types of documentation, while facilitators create them for enrollees who cannot do so themselves. Practitioners also supervise facilitators and communicate with both types of&nbsp;users.

Testing of the units and phases is performed daily in the form of manual smoke and exploratory testing for different kinds of end&#8209;users. After completing comprehensive general exploratory testing of each unit in the QA environment, we move on to ticket verification, regression testing, and sanity testing on the UAT staging server. Before the end of each sprint, we thoroughly test the live production server and verify the update based on the sprint's&nbsp;scope.

Throughout the testing process, we provide developers with hourly status reports and report any regression defects immediately. This allows for a quick response to any issues and minimizes any negative impact on&nbsp;users.

## Value delivered

With our rigorous testing approach, we set out to identify any potential issues that threatened to impact the platform's effectiveness. Our focus on testing across multiple browsers and platforms helps us ensure that the application is accessible to a wide range of users, regardless of their device or preferred&nbsp;browser.

Our team is particularly focused on making sure that the platform is inclusive and user&#8209;friendly. By leveraging our deep understanding of user experience and accessibility best practices, we are able to provide valuable feedback to the development team. This feedback is instrumental in improving the platform's user interface and accessibility features.

We are proud to play an important role in helping our client deliver a solution that meets the needs of all users, regardless of their age or&nbsp;ability.
