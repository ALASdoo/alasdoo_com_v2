## About the client

Our client is a digital logistics company that began as a small, innovative start&#8209;up and has since expanded into a major player in the logistics industry. They streamline the entire shipping process, from calculating freight costs to managing transport.

Their cutting&#8209;edge platform provides a seamless and efficient booking process, unparalleled customer service, and dependable transport management for airlines and forwarders alike.

Thanks to their advanced digital technologies and established partnerships with leading transport networks, this company is spearheading the future of logistics today.

## Clientâ€™s challenges

To stay competitive, the air cargo industry must reduce costs and improve efficiency through technology and automation due to competition from cheaper options such as truck and rail carriers.

By integrating software development and quality assurance practices into supply chain planning and monitoring, the risk of human errors can be significantly reduced, leading to improved quality throughout the process and software. Our client values our unwavering commitment to quality assurance and proven track record, making it a key reason they choose to work with us.

## Our approach

### Manual testing

We perform various manual testing tasks, including end&#8209;to&#8209;end testing, regression testing, exploratory testing, and test case maintenance, to guarantee that the application is of the highest quality.

We conduct end&#8209;to&#8209;end testing, testing the user journey from the first interaction to the final outcome, to ensure that all components of the web application work together seamlessly.

Regression testing helps us verify that changes or new features added to the project do not have any unintended consequences or cause any issues with existing functionality. We also maintain our test cases based on new user stories to make sure that our testing remains relevant and up to date. As new features are introduced, we update our test cases to ensure that we continue to cover all aspects of the application.

We utilize Jira for ticket verification. Once the tickets have been verified, the next step is to report any issues that may have been identified. Using Jira for ticket verification and issue reporting enables us to collaborate effectively, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals. It also helps to identify issues and potential roadblocks early on, allowing our client's development team to take corrective action before they become major problems.

### Automated testing

We use [Katalon Studio](https://katalon.com/) to automate our testing processes. Code&#8209;based automation tools become complex and time&#8209;consuming to maintain when developing frequently changing features. Codeless automation tools like Katalon are a more accessible, faster, easier to maintain, flexible, and cost&#8209;effective solution. They allow tests to be quickly and easily maintained without additional costs.

By integrating Katalon with [TestOps](https://katalon.com/testops), we manage our tests more efficiently, as we can plan, execute, and report on tests from a single platform. TestOps provides detailed analytics and reporting capabilities, allowing our team to track test results, identify trends, and make informed decisions about future testing efforts.

### DataDog monitoring

[DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) monitoring is a tool we use to track various performance metrics and KPIs of our client's applications. By tracking these KPIs, we can quickly identify any issues and take corrective action before they impact end users. DataDog also offers powerful error-tracking capabilities. It automatically detects and aggregates errors from various sources, including logs, metrics, and traces.

### Release and QA sprint reports

Our client is using the Agile methodology. Throughout each sprint, we have daily, sprint planning, and sprint demo meetings. Additionally, we have a "Weekly QA Review" with our client's CTO to discuss news, plans, and problems. Our team prioritizes honest and transparent communication during all interactions.

We generate release and QA sprint reports to keep track of the progress of the project during these sprints.

Sprint release reports are sent when the client has a release on staging and production. During this process, we perform comprehensive end&#8209;to&#8209;end tests, which include automated testing and manual testing for areas that are not covered by automation. The report includes the testing status (in progress or completed), details of any blockers, and any other bugs we observed during testing. Additionally, it contains a verification report on tickets for staging or production (Hotfix retest).

The QA sprint report, on the other hand, provides information on the testing process, including the number of test cases executed, the number of defects found and fixed, the number of outstanding defects, and risks or issues that need to be addressed before the release can be considered stable.

## Value delivered

By performing manual testing, our team ensures that the client's web application is of high quality and free from any unintended consequences or issues. Moreover, the team collaborates effectively by utilizing Jira for ticket verification and issue reporting, which enables everyone to work towards the same goals and identify potential issues and roadblocks early on.

With the implementation of the codeless automation tool ([Katalon](https://katalon.com/)), we have established a more accessible, faster, easier to maintain, flexible, and cost&#8209;effective solution compared to code&#8209;based automation.

Having been involved in the project from its early stages, we possess a thorough understanding of its intricacies, which makes us an integrated part of the client's team. Our attention to detail and proactive approach have contributed to the smooth operation of the project for over three years.
