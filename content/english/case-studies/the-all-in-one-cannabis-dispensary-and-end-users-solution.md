## About the client

Our client offers a cannabis Point of Sale system designed for dispensaries of any size, with software solutions for both front&#8209;of&#8209;house and back&#8209;of&#8209;house operations. Its modern interface is designed to help dispensaries all over USA work more efficiently and comply with regulations.

The system includes essential hardware, such as a customer&#8209;facing display, cash drawer, receipt printer, back office printer, and barcode scanner, to streamline the in&#8209;store experience.

With this all&#8209;in&#8209;one solution, dispensaries can start selling quickly and efficiently.

## Clientâ€™s challenges

Although the acceptance of cannabis is increasing globally, it still remains illegal in several regions and states, making it challenging for companies in the industry to comply with regulations and navigate complex legal frameworks.

The cannabis industry is highly regulated and it is crucial to comply with laws and regulations to avoid legal issues. For example, purchasers must have a valid identification card issued by the specific state where they intend to buy cannabis products.

In addition to having a valid card issued by the specific state, purchasers must also be of legal age, which varies from state to state, to purchase cannabis products. Furthermore, the quantities of cannabis that can be purchased and possessed legally can vary greatly between states.

The client utilized our services to ensure their business was compliant with various purchasing regulations and to develop a fully functional, user&#8209;friendly app. Our testing services covered both software and hardware testing to achieve these objectives.

## Our approach

### Web application testing

We performed manual testing of the web application on desktop, utilizing various testing methods such as smoke testing, regression testing, and exploratory testing. This allowed us to thoroughly test the software's functionality and ensure that it was user&#8209;friendly and intuitive for our client's customers. To verify that the system was functioning smoothly, we had to perform smoke tests every day, as the client was working on daily releases.

We conducted API testing, which included validating the API's functionality, performance, reliability, and security, to make sure it met the requirements outlined by the client.

During the testing process, we improved existing and developed new test cases specifically for automation purposes. By doing so, we provided our client with a set of reliable automated test cases that could be easily integrated into their automation processes.

We utilized [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), a robust issue-tracking and project management tool, to effectively manage defects and prioritize bug fixes. By verifying tickets and reporting issues uncovered during testing, we maintained a clear and organized record of all reported issues.

Effective creation and use of necessary documentation were achieved through [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), a versatile tool that streamlines the process of creating and collaborating on documents.

By providing regular performance reporting that utilizes weekly and monthly metrics, we were able to effectively track and analyze key performance indicators for the clients' business.

### Hardware (IoT) testing

In addition to testing the web application, our team also conducted testing of smart hardware payment systems, cash registers, and various IoT solutions, ranging from card readers to receipt printers.

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the devices, our testing approach was based on rigorous functional testing. We focused on configuring the devices properly and testing their ability to process transactions accurately. Additionally, we paid close attention to the connection between the cash register and the application, making sure that they were properly integrated and communicated seamlessly. This testing included both end&#8209;to&#8209;end testing and testing of individual components of the device's software to ensure that they were functioning as intended.

For IoT solutions such as card readers and receipt printers, we employed a similar approach, focusing on functionality, usability, and compatibility with the client's software. We made certain that the proper receipt was printed when a user completed a transaction. This involved validating that the receipt contained all necessary information, such as transaction details and itemized prices.

### Database testing

Database testing is a critical aspect of software testing, as it guarantees that data is being stored, retrieved, and processed accurately within the database. Our team sought to ensure the accuracy of every transaction completed on the page, thereby guaranteeing that the data reflected in the database is consistent and reliable.

## Value delivered

Through our testing services, we helped our client navigate the complex legal frameworks and regulations governing the cannabis industry. By achieving compliance, our client avoided potential legal consequences and provided a hassle&#8209;free experience for their customers.

By conducting detailed testing of the web platform, including hardware (IoT) and database testing, we were able to make sure that the software was fully functional, user&#8209;friendly, and optimized for performance.

To provide a seamless experience for the end user and address any potential issues that may have arisen during integration with other systems, we conducted API testing. This approach helped us thoroughly validate the integrity of the system's data and ensure that any errors or discrepancies were identified and addressed promptly.

Since the client was releasing updates daily, it was crucial for us to perform smoke tests every day to ensure the smooth operation of the system. We ran approximately 1,000 test cases per week during smoke testing to ensure the product's reliability and quality. Additionally, we wrote new test cases and maintained existing ones as necessary.
