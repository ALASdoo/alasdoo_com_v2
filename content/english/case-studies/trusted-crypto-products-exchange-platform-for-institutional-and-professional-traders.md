## About the client

Our client has a well-established exchange platform that services institutional and professional traders. They have been in the industry since 2014, which has given them ample experience and knowledge on how to weather storms and navigate challenges.

The platform prioritizes providing a seamless trading experience for its customers by offering low latency, improved liquidity, and better availability.

## Client’s challenges

Our client faced the critical challenge of balancing the security of their platform with a seamless trading experience.

As a digital asset exchange platform, the client had to make sure that their system's features and functionality were working correctly to provide their customers with fast and reliable access to the markets. At the same time, they had to prioritize the security of their customers' funds and personal information.

Cryptocurrencies face limitations in certain countries due to concerns about regulation, with some countries banning their use over fear of illegal activities. The client enlisted our services primarily to verify the authorization of individuals from specific states on the platform before allowing them to engage in trading.

## Our approach

In order to effectively test the exchange platform, it is essential to have a fundamental understanding of the investment market. The primary focus of testing should be on the user's smart contracts and peer-to-peer automated trading rather than the cryptocurrency itself. It is important to check if contracts are executed correctly according to desired conditions, such as targets and limits. By conducting thorough testing of these features, we can make sure that the platform is functioning as intended and that users can safely and confidently exchange digital assets.

It was important to continuously compare testnet environment functionalities with the live environment’s ones. We paid close attention to features like withdrawals, deposits, and placing orders, with parameters such as leverage, trigger price, and stop-losses.

### Experience-based testing

To ensure the P2P crypto-product trading platform performs effectively in real-world scenarios, we employed a diverse range of testing techniques, including exploratory testing, usability testing, and user acceptance testing. Our testing team simulated experiences of various users, from novices to experts, and thoroughly tested the platform's functionality, usability, and overall user experience.

We created numerous trading scenarios to assess the platform's ability to execute orders, handle various assets and currencies, and provide real-time market data. Through testing these scenarios, we could detect and resolve issues before they affected users.

### Cross-browser and cross-platform testing

Order creation underwent a rigorous functional testing process that involved comparing values on the mobile application with those displayed on the web application. It was important to conduct cross-platform testing since users may choose to trade cryptocurrencies on different devices and platforms. This included testing on desktop browsers as well as various mobile operating systems and versions.

Given the prevalence of mobile usage, testing was primarily focused on mobile applications in both testnet and live environments. To achieve this, physical devices were utilized in order to provide valuable insights into the user experience.

By testing on a range of devices and platforms, we could confirm that the platform performs consistently and effectively, regardless of how users choose to access it.

### KYC integration, system, and acceptance testing

We completed rigorous functional testing on the integrated "Know Your Customer" (KYC) process which involved collecting and verifying customer information, including identification documents, to prevent fraud and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

Ensuring that the application was fully compatible with the regulations of all supported states was a top priority. To achieve this, we conducted extensive localization testing with additional verification methods for user identity.

We performed system and acceptance testing to assure that the system was functioning as expected and met the client's requirements. The testing process involved multiple activities, including verifying the accuracy and completeness of customer information, validating identification documents, and performing several other checks to uphold the integrity of the KYC process.

### Retesting and verifying defects, user stories, and features

To confirm the system's complete functionality, we conducted thorough retesting and defect verification after the issue was fixed. This process involved not only retesting the affected part of the application but also ensuring that the fix did not break other features.

We checked that all features and functionalities met the acceptance criteria outlined in the user stories, by meticulously creating detailed test plans and test cases. We documented all defects discovered during testing and collaborated with the development team to resolve them as promptly as possible.

## Value delivered

The testing approach employed by our QA team included exploratory testing, usability testing, user acceptance testing, and cross-browser and cross-platform testing. This approach aimed to establish that our client's platform performed consistently and effectively, regardless of how users accessed it.

We also conducted extensive retesting and defect verification to confirm that all features and functionalities met the acceptance criteria outlined in the user stories.

To prevent fraudulent activities and ensure compliance with regulations, we conducted a comprehensive testing of the "Know Your Customer" (KYC) process, with a special focus on localization testing to confirm the suitability for a region a customer is signing up from.

As a result, our client received a reliable, secure platform that can handle various trading scenarios and customer needs while being compliant with legal regulations.
