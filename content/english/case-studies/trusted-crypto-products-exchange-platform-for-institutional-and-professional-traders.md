## About the client

Our client has a well-established exchange platform that focuses on providing institutional and professional traders with the tools they need to succeed. They have been in the industry since 2014, which has given them ample experience and knowledge on how to weather storms and navigate challenges.

Their platform offers lower latency, better liquidity, and availability to ensure that their customers have a seamless trading experience.

They prioritize the security of their customers' funds and offer a variety of products and tools to help them make informed trading decisions.

## Clientâ€™s challenges

Our client faced the critical challenge of balancing the security and integrity of their platform with providing users with a seamless trading experience.

As a digital asset exchange platform, the client had to ensure that their system's features and functionality were working correctly to provide their customers with fast and reliable access to the markets. At the same time, they had to prioritize the security of their customers' funds and personal information.

## Our approach

In order to effectively test the exchange platform, it is essential to have a fundamental understanding of the investment market. The primary focus of testing should be on the user's smart contracts and peer-to-peer automated trading, rather than the cryptocurrency itself. It is important to verify that contracts are executed correctly according to desired conditions, such as targets and limits. By conducting thorough testing of these features, we can ensure that the platform is functioning as intended and that users can safely and confidently exchange digital assets.

While it's not necessary to have a deep understanding of cryptocurrencies, it's important to pay special attention to the testnet environment of the platform. This is especially true for beginners who are looking to explore and learn about the market before engaging in actual trading with real currencies. By practicing on the testnet, users can gain experience and familiarize themselves with the platform's features, such as placing orders with parameters like leverage, trigger price, and stop-losses. This approach helps limit potential losses and ensures that users are prepared and confident when they do start trading with real assets.

### Experience-based testing

To ensure the P2P crypto-product trading platform performs effectively in real-world scenarios, we employed a diverse range of testing techniques, including exploratory testing, usability testing, and user acceptance testing. Our testing team simulated the experiences of various users, from novices to experts, and thoroughly tested the platform's functionality, usability, and overall user experience.

We created numerous trading scenarios to assess the platform's ability to execute orders, handle various assets and currencies, and provide real-time market data. By testing these scenarios, we could identify and resolve issues before they impacted users and ensure that the platform could effectively handle different trading scenarios.

### Cross-browser and cross-platform testing

Order creation undergoes a rigorous functional testing process that involves comparing mobile device values with those displayed on the web application. It's important to conduct cross-platform testing since users may choose to trade cryptocurrencies on different devices and platforms. This includes testing on desktop browsers as well as various mobile device operating systems and versions.

Given the prevalence of mobile usage, testing primarily focuses on mobile applications in both environments. To achieve this, physical devices are utilized, providing valuable insights into the user experience.

By testing on a range of devices and platforms, we can ensure that the platform performs consistently and effectively, regardless of how users choose to access it.

### KYC integration, system, and acceptance testing

We integrated a "Know Your Customer" (KYC) process which involved collecting and verifying customer information, including identification documents, to prevent fraud and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

We performed system and acceptance testing to verify that the system was functioning as expected and met the client's requirements. This involved several activities, including verifying the accuracy and completeness of customer information, validating identification documents, and performing various other checks to ensure the integrity of the KYC process.

### Retesting and verifying defects, user stories, and features

To ensure the system was fully functional, we conducted extensive retesting and defect verification. This involved not only retesting the affected system and features but also verifying that the fixes did not impact any other system components.

We meticulously verified that all features and functionality met the acceptance criteria outlined in the user stories, creating detailed test plans and test cases for each test. We closely documented any defects discovered during testing, working hand in hand with the development team to resolve them as quickly as possible.
