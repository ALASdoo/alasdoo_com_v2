## About the client

Our client has developed an exceptional integrated healthcare workflow platform that is revolutionizing the way physicians, nurses, and clinic administrators manage patient care. Designed in collaboration with healthcare professionals, this platform enhances workflow efficiency, improves patient outcomes, and reduces costs.

The platform enables physicians to efficiently manage appointments, share patient data, and communicate and collaborate from anywhere, using any device. With an uncluttered workspace and ease of use, the platform provides an exceptional user experience. Its mobile-first design and flexible response methods allow physicians to save time and focus on what really matters - their patients. Customizable workflows further enhance efficiency, enabling physicians to tailor the platform to their specific needs.

Furthermore, the platform is HIPAA and HITECH-compliant, ensuring that patient data is secure and protected.

## Clientâ€™s challenges

Given this application's critical role in the healthcare system, the importance of a good user experience cannot be overstated, as it directly affects the health and well-being of patients. A bad user experience in this context is not just a matter of customer dissatisfaction but can have serious implications for human lives and the sustainability of the healthcare system, especially in periods of crisis.

Our team understands the critical importance of this application and has extensive experience in testing scheduling and communication management systems used by hospitals and clinics. We were hired by this client specifically for our meticulous and thorough approach to testing, which ensures that the application performs flawlessly and provides a seamless user experience for healthcare professionals and patients alike.

## Our approach

At the start of the testing iteration, we began by thoroughly reviewing the user stories created and provided by the client. We also conducted several pre-testing brainstorming sessions to gather feedback and insights during the planning stage.

Once the test stories were created, we carefully planned our test runs to ensure that all aspects of the application were thoroughly tested. Throughout the development cycle, we worked closely with the development team to create test cases that were aligned with the app's functionality and design. These test cases were then grouped into test runs for maximum efficiency and coverage.

We conducted confirmatory testing right after implementation, with the goal of identifying and addressing any defects as early as possible in the development cycle. When bugs were found, we listed them in the corresponding stories to provide developers with the information they needed to improve the app.

We used Redmine, a project management tool, to report and track issues and defects, and we conducted retesting to ensure that issues had been resolved.

Thorough cross-browser and cross-platform testing were implemented to ensure compatibility of the application on different devices and environments, including web and mobile applications, and VOIP answering service. We focused on verifying the compatibility and consistency of data across these environments.

The platform's flexible and scalable on-call schedule is a standout feature that helps manage physician availability and ensures seamless patient care. We extensively tested the in-app call feature, including all possible flows based on the proposed algorithm. Additionally, we conducted acceptance testing of the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system to ensure that it accurately recognized and responded to user input and provided appropriate responses.

Testing was conducted to verify that the physician-set reminders for patients, such as attending appointments, taking medications, and providing lab samples, were functioning as intended. This feature is designed to improve the organization and reduce omissions in the medical treatment process.

We also tested messaging functionality used exclusively by the medical team, which focuses on urgent message handling. Our test checklist verifies that important notifications have a distinctive design and are sent frequently enough to increase the chance of physicians seeing them as soon as possible. We ensure that messages can be sent to an individual or a team and that team members are notified correctly and promptly when assigned to a call.

## Value delivered

Our testing cycle has been highly effective in evaluating a healthcare application's features, cross-browser compatibility, and UI design. The testing process involved creating and reviewing user stories, conducting confirmatory testing, and verifying data accuracy and consistency across different environments. The primary goal of this testing was to enhance the user experience, boost efficiency and productivity, and ultimately support the sustainability of the healthcare system.

As part of this testing, we thoroughly evaluated the in-app call to a physician and messaging system, providing valuable feedback for developers to enhance the application's performance and ensure the security of private data for patients and medical workers.
