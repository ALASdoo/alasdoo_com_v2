## About the client

Our client provides cloud&#8209;native eClinical applications that accelerate the delivery of new treatments to patients worldwide.

Their smart, unified, and easy&#8209;to&#8209;use platform streamlines clinical trial and quality management processes for life science companies in Biotech, Pharma, Clinical Research, Medical Devices, and Medical Research.

By automating and accelerating the delivery of new drugs, therapies, and treatments, they are making a significant impact on the healthcare industry.

## Clientâ€™s challenges

Our client understands the critical need for reliable and accurate software in the medical and clinical fields. That's why they hired us to implement rigorous testing protocols to ensure the safety and efficiency of patient care, clinical trials, and research projects.

We employ a combination of automated and manual testing methods to achieve a comprehensive testing process. This approach provides a robust and reliable testing process for software used in medical and clinical studies.

By facilitating collaboration and management among healthcare professionals, researchers, and other stakeholders involved in clinical studies, we ensure that the software systems are efficient and reliable.

## Our approach

Our approach involves a thorough process of creating a test plan based on [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) tickets, followed by the creation of test cases on [TestRail](https://www.testrail.com/).

We start by performing manual exploratory testing on recently implemented features. Based on this, we write up and plan automated test scripts and use tools such as Java, JUnit, Selenium, and Appium to automate test cases. These scripts are then grouped into test suites, maintained, and executed regularly. This enables us to execute tests and generate reports according to defined test processes and issue reporting.

To ensure stability during the development process and consistent quality at releases, we group complex test cases into smoke and regression test runs. This approach enables us to identify any issues or regressions that may occur after new features or updates are introduced to the software. By performing these tests regularly, we can ensure that the software remains stable and reliable throughout the development process. We create all the necessary documentation for both minor and major releases to ensure consistent quality and stability during development.

The software features mainly involve gathering and sorting details and documentation required for health research, such as clinics' and participants' details, patients' consent, analysis results, and schedules. The data is accessible to users with different access policies based on their authorization and role in a clinical study. We ensure that the software meets all regulatory and compliance requirements and that the privacy and confidentiality of patient information are maintained.

We place significant emphasis on testing the online signature feature for medical documentation, which allows researchers to sign documents once all associated researchers have agreed. This feature aims to promote successful collaboration among clinics while ensuring efficient time management.

In addition to our testing processes, we ensure that closed studies remain accessible if the data is relevant for new analyses. Confidentiality is a top priority for us, and we take all necessary measures to protect sensitive medical documentation.

## Value delivered

Our client's clinical management software was enhanced with the successful implementation of rigorous testing protocols by our team. We ensured that the software met all regulatory and compliance requirements while prioritizing the privacy and confidentiality of patient information.

Our testing efforts were particularly focused on the online signature feature for medical documentation, which enables efficient collaboration among clinics across the country while ensuring good time management practices.

We took great care to protect the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive medical documentation while ensuring that closed studies remained accessible for new analyses. Our approach included implementing necessary security measures to safeguard the data and ensuring that authorized personnel could access it as needed. This enabled our client to continue to make meaningful contributions to medical research and improve patient care.
