This accessibility statement applies to the [www.alasdoo.com](https://www.alasdoo.com) website.

## Commitment to accessibility

At ALAS doo, we are committed to accessibility â€” not only in our digital products and services but also throughout our organization and internal processes.

For our digital products, this means providing equal access to information, interactions, and services for all users, regardless of their abilities.

Our accessibility services, offered under the AccessLiaison brand, are designed to deliver digital accessibility efficiently and thoroughly.

For us, accessibility is an ongoing process of continuous improvement, including our knowledge, methods, and tools.

## Conformance status

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. The ALAS doo website is fully conformant with the latest version, which is WCAG 2.2, at AA level.

### Additional accessibility considerations

While our goal is WCAG 2.2 level AA conformance, we have also applied some level AAA Success Criteria:

- Images of text are only used for decorative purposes.
- Text is not justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins).
- Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.
- The "reduce motion" browser preference is supported.
- Information about the user's location within the website is available.
- The purpose of each link can be identified from link text alone.
- Section headings are used to organize the content.
- Components that receive keyboard focus are fully visible.
- Visibility of the focus indicator is enhanced.

### Ongoing efforts

We are constantly improving user experience and accessibility of our website, going beyond legal requirements. Current enhancements in progress include:

- A switch to turn off unnecessary animations
- Dark mode preference, based on browser settings and an on-site control
- Icons indicating when links open in a new tab

## Feedback and support

If you encounter any accessibility barriers or have suggestions to improve your experience, please contact our IAAP-certified Chief Accessibility Officer, Tajana Somodji, at:

## Compatibility with browsers and assistive technology
