culture:

  subtitle: "We take great pride in our culture"
  content: "We are not corporate. We were founded as a small family company, and although we have significantly grown, our business approach still integrates family values.


  With our personal approach we help employees achieve their full potential by taking into account strengths and aspirations of each worker, finding the right place in the company for them, and supporting and guiding them in their journey of professional self-actualization.


  Our employees are participants in decision making, as their opinions, initiatives, and ideas are always heard and welcomed. Constructive suggestions can promptly come to life with our flat hierarchy and short decision making paths.


  We nurture an inclusive culture. We don’t force people to be who they are not, but we cherish the diversity. Our team’s strength comes not only from our different backgrounds, expertise, and selfless knowledge sharing but also from our mutual trust and respect."

onboarding:
  title: "Onboarding"
  subtitle: "Knowledge sharing, support, and open communication from day one"
  content: "We strive to have a bureaucracy- and ego-free hiring process that provides a welcoming experience for new employees. It's impossible to test everything with interviews and general tests, so instead of overcomplicating the process itself, if a candidate seems like a good fit, we take them on for a trial period of 3 months, with an extension being discussed after 2 months.


  General onboarding to the company aims to facilitate the process of a coworker’s introduction to the protocols, rules, and projects of the company on the one hand, and on the other, to provide feedback on a candidate's capabilities to follow the team dynamics and project requirements.


  During the onboarding process, you won't be alone because you'll be surrounded by experienced coworkers who are eager to assist and share their knowledge. Additionally, you will be assigned an onboarding buddy who will guide you through the process and is always accessible for feedback, consultation, and assistance."
