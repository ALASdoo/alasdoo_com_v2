  title: "We take great pride in our culture"
  content: "We are not corporate. We were founded as a small family company, and although we have significantly grown, our business approach still integrates family values.


  With our personal approach we help employees achieve their full potential by taking into account strengths and aspirations of each worker, finding the right place in the company for them, and supporting and guiding them in their journey of professional self&#8209;actualization.


  Our employees are participants in decision making, as their opinions, initiatives, and ideas are always heard and welcomed. Constructive suggestions can promptly come to life with our flat hierarchy and short decision making paths."
