    content : "The story of ALAS begins in 1988 when computer science was just finding its footing in Serbia. Sandor Somogyi and Dragan Nedeljkovic, the advocates of the application of computer technology, have joined forces with some of the most important IT developers in Zrenjanin, and founded the company that has become the symbol of change, a synonym of modern times, and the correct way of incorporating and developing information technologies in large agricultural and manufacturing systems."

    image: "images/how-it-works/02.jpg"
    content : "The new era of ALAS began in 2009, when Vilmos Somogyi, Sandor's son, took over as CEO. Together with Tibor Dudjik, they shifted the company's focus to outsourcing IT services while upholding the primary ideology of finding the best way to integrate the most recent information technologies into all industries, prioritizing quality, and fostering a welcoming workplace environment for him and his coworkers."

We have [clients from all over the world](clients/) thanks to our enthusiasm for innovation and dedication to quality.

  title: "Our values"
  content: "Our values and culture are extremely important to us, as we believe that only an environment that is supportive and collaborative can help us accomplish our maximum."
  values_list:
  - title: "Personal approach"
    content: "Our main focus is on people's needs, dreams, and pain points. They guide us as we try to solve their problems, offer advice, set the direction, and create the optimal work model. We build honest relationships through open communication, taking into account the unique personalities and skill sets of each employee, as well as the specifics of each project we take on.
    Our goal is to create a better future for everyone. By increasing the quality of life, in whatever ways we can, for as many people as we can, we believe that we contribute something valuable."

  - title: "Controlled growth"
    content: "Steady but slow and controlled growth is our chosen path. We are not corporate. We started as a small family company, and although we have significantly grown, our business approach still integrates family values.
    Every change is met by an adequate organization and a period of adaptation, taking care that the quality of work is not affected. We have accomplished this not only through a careful selection of clients and projects but also by employing people who share the same values as we do and are valuable assets to their teams."

  - title: "Highest standards"
    content: "No matter how big or small the project, we are devoted to giving our very best, maintaining rigorous standards, and holding ourselves accountable for the results. We take great care to fully grasp our client's needs and see the whole picture. Our team is empowered to look for ways to make life easier for our clients. Realizing the little things can sometimes make a big difference.
    Only great people can create great results. Therefore, while hiring, we look for quality rather than quantity. Not only that, but we nurture a culture of loyal teammates who have a sense of ownership and genuinely care about achieving results."

  - title: "Responsible flexibility"
    content: "We believe that exceptional work doesn’t require strict rules and that we can have a great organization with everyone on our team living on their terms. It is important to recognize that work is just a single component of a larger picture of life responsibilities, obligations, goals, and interests.
    Our employees are given the freedom and flexibility to build a responsible work-life model that reflects the needs of their unique lifestyles while still enabling them to achieve maximum productivity. This is a natural win-win-win for our company, employees, and clients."

  - title: "Diversity and inclusion"
    content: "Not having our focus on “culture fit” but on “values fit” and “culture contribution” helps us hire people who share our goals, not necessarily our viewpoints or backgrounds. By cherishing and celebrating differences and authenticity, we foster a culture of inclusiveness and belonging while staying true to our values, remaining united in the core beliefs that make Alas the company that we know and love. Our philosophy is that bringing your authentic self to work, along with all the ideas and experiences that make you unique, helps build a vibrant community that can move mountains."

  - title: "Team spirit"
    content: "Our team's strength lies not just in our combined experience and expertise but also in our ability to trust each other, no matter the circumstances. We are aware that our best work is not produced by individuals but by collaboration, dependability of each member, putting “us” before “me”, selfless knowledge sharing, everyday encouragement, and support.
    We thrive in a positive environment where everybody’s heard and understood, people are polite and assertive, and tackle challenges head-on, having fun along the way.
    This team mentality extends to our clients as well, as we approach every business relationship as a partnership and work collaboratively with each other to meet mutual goals."

  - title: "High work ethics"
    content: "In everything we do and with everyone we do business with, we act with uncompromising honesty and integrity. This specifically means transparent communication (no smoke and mirrors, just the truth), respecting deadlines and budgets, being upfront when errors occur, and taking ownership of everything we do. We deliver what is agreed upon and always make that extra effort. We have thorough documentation to back up our processes and are always available to address any concerns and provide information"

  - title: "Continuous improvement"
    content: "People who strive for bigger and better things, and who put extra effort into their individual growth are very precious to us. We are here to guide them on their road to success, empower them to reach their full potential, and shift to a growth mindset.
    Both as a company and as individuals, we are constantly improving. Although we have well-established workflows and tried-and-true methods, we are always searching for different approaches to face challenges. We value ideas over hierarchy, thus empowering our employees to be decision-makers. New ideas can promptly come to life with our flat hierarchy and short decision-making paths.
    Education should be a lifelong endeavor, and this type of continuous learning is what continues to push us forward."

  - title: "Work hard, play harder"
    content: "We enjoy the work we do and the people we are fortunate to do it with.
    We nurture a community of inspiring people who are valued, heard, motivated, and accomplished by supporting them to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle, regularly check their travel bucket lists, and dedicate time and energy to their families and hobbies.
    An environment with less stress and more positive energy is what we all strive for. Alas is about giving everybody their space and a distraction-free environment, as well as opportunities for fun, relaxation, and socializing."
